# Akiya Reborn – Bringing Forgotten Homes On-Chain

Akiya Reborn is a Web3-powered platform that revitalizes Japan’s abandoned homes (akiya) by turning them into stayable, community-owned spaces through NFTs and DAO governance.

🏠 **Real-world utility**: Backers receive NFTs that unlock priority stays, event access, and voting rights  
🔗 **Built on Solana**: Fast, low-cost, on-chain interactions  
🛠️ **dApp features**: Property funding, booking, renovation tracking, and DAO proposals  
🌍 **Cultural impact**: Supporting rural regeneration and sustainable tourism
